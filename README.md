Problem statement: 
Book Library Application: Develop a book library application where users can add, search,
and categorise books in their collection.

Problem Statement Brief: 
The Book Library project aims to create a web application that allows users to manage and
organise their personal book collections. Users will be able to keep track of their books, add
new books, search for books. The project will be built using the MERN stack (MongoDB,
Express.js, React, and Node.js) to ensure a full-stack development approach.

Features:
1. User Registration and Authentication:
    ● Users can create an account and log in securely.
    ● User authentication will be implemented to ensure data privacy.
2. Book Management: 
    ● Users can add new books to their library by entering book details such as title, 
    author, genre, publication date, and book cover image.
    ● Users can edit and delete books from their library.
3. Book Search and Filtering:
    ● Users can search for books in their library based on various criteria such as
    title, author, or genre.
    ● Filtering options will help users find books based on different parameters.
4. User Interface and Experience:
    ● The application will have a responsive and intuitive user interface for seamless
    usage across devices.
    ● User-friendly interactions and visualisations will enhance the user experience.
